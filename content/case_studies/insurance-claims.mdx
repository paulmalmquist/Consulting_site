### Situation
Claims teams were overwhelmed by exception handling, with inconsistent escalation and limited visibility into risk.

### What we did
- Mapped exception triggers and the systems of record involved.
- Introduced a knowledge base with verified policy citations.
- Designed a human-in-the-loop model for high-risk claims.

### Outcome
- Escalation volume dropped by 25%.
- High-risk claims were flagged within the same day.
- Compliance reporting improved with consistent citations.

### Why it matters
When exceptions scale, manual triage collapses. The redesigned workflow preserved human judgment where it matters most.
