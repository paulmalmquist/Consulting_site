### Context
A legal operations team was buried in unstructured intake, email-based triage, and unclear decision ownership.

### What was broken
- Intake questions varied by paralegal.
- Exceptions were escalated informally with no audit trail.
- Systems of record were updated after the fact.

### What was redesigned
- A structured intake flow tied to decision rules and exception categories.
- A decision ladder with explicit escalation thresholds.
- HITL checkpoints that captured evidence before routing.

### Outcome
Triage became predictable, exceptions were visible, and leadership had line-of-sight from request to resolution without sacrificing governance.
