### Situation
Finance operations relied on manual approvals for exceptions and vendor payments. Decision ownership was unclear, leading to delays and rework.

### What we did
- Built a decision ladder tied to approval thresholds.
- Created structured knowledge objects for policy and vendor history.
- Implemented human-in-the-loop checkpoints with audit logs.

### Outcome
- Approval turnaround improved by 35%.
- Audit trail coverage rose to 98% for exceptions.
- Leadership gained visibility into decision bottlenecks.

### Why it matters
AI routing only works when governance is explicit. The new operating model aligned approvals with risk.
