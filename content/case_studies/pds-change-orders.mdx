### Context
A project delivery team managed change orders across multiple sites with inconsistent approval logic.

### What was broken
- Field teams escalated inconsistently.
- Finance and legal reviews were late and reactive.
- Decision latency created downstream scheduling risk.

### What was redesigned
- A structured change-order intake with decision thresholds.
- Explicit escalation paths for cost and risk exceptions.
- Governance checkpoints aligned to systems of record.

### Outcome
Change orders moved faster, approvals were defensible, and the delivery team regained operational clarity.
