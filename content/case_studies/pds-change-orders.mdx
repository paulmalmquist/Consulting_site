### Situation
A capital projects team faced a backlog of change orders. Requests were routed through email and spreadsheets, with inconsistent approvals and missing audit trails.

### What we did
- Mapped the work graph across project managers, procurement, and finance.
- Defined a decision ladder with approval thresholds.
- Implemented a retrieval layer for contract clauses and past change orders.

### Outcome
- Decision latency dropped by 40%.
- Exception handling became consistent and auditable.
- The team could prioritize high-risk changes without losing context.

### Why it matters
Change orders are where margin disappears. The new workflow made the system defensible and scalable.
