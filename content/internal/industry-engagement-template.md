# Industry Engagement Template (Internal)

## 1) Operational Lifecycle
For each stage define:
- Stage name (practitioner terminology)
- Key artifacts
- Owner roles
- System dependencies
- Audit markers: Owner | Version | Log | Control

## 2) System Fragmentation
- List commonly integrated systems.
- Define failure mechanics:
  - status mismatch
  - version drift
  - manual reconciliation
  - ownership ambiguity
  - unlogged approvals
  - escalation gaps

## 3) Failure Mechanics
Specify exactly:
- where data diverges
- where lifecycle states are undefined
- where audit trails break
- where approvals become informal
- where reporting is non-reproducible
- where turnover erodes operational memory

## 4) What We Reconstruct
State clearly:
- Define canonical states
- Enforce owner assignment
- Version-control artifacts
- Log approvals/escalations
- Normalize taxonomy
- Produce audit-ready outputs
- Core systems remain in place

## 5) Engagement Model
- Phase 1 — Operational Audit
- Phase 2 — Control Definition
- Phase 3 — Execution Layer Build
- Phase 4 — Continuity Transfer

For each phase include objective + outputs.

## 6) Executive Outcomes
List measurable outcomes with control and reporting impact.
