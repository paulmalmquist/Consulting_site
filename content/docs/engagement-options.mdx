Not every organization is ready for a full three-phase engagement. We offer two paths depending on your risk posture, budget, and timeline.

## Standard program

The full three-phase engagement: Dependency Diagnostic, Capability Pilot, and Controlled Cutover Program.

**Best for:** Organizations that have already identified system dependency as a strategic risk and have executive sponsorship to act.

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (diagnostic) + 4-8 weeks (pilot) + roadmap-led (cutover program)

**What you get:** End-to-end governance from risk mapping through production cutover, with evidence gates at every phase transition.

**How it starts:** [Run the Dependency Diagnostic](/services)

## Lighter baseline start

A short execution baseline to map one workflow, clarify boundaries, and reduce fragility — without replacing core systems or committing to a full program.

**Best for:** Teams that need to build internal confidence before proposing a larger engagement. Also useful when budget is constrained or when the organization needs a concrete artifact before allocating program funding.

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

**What you get:** A capability control map and stabilization plan for one workflow. Clear enough to present to leadership as a case for further action — or to use standalone as an operational improvement.

**How it starts:** [Start the diagnostic](/services)

## When to pick each path

| Consideration | Standard program | Lighter baseline |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Executive sponsorship | In place | Not yet secured |
| Budget | Program-level | Project-level |
| Risk tolerance | Ready to pilot | Need proof first |
| Desired outcome | Production cutover | Decision-ready artifact |
| Timeline pressure | Immediate | Exploratory |

Both paths use the same method, the same governance controls, and the same evidence standards. The lighter baseline is a subset of Phase 1 — if you choose to continue, nothing is repeated.
