Two paths depending on risk posture, budget, and timeline.

## Standard program
- **Structure:** Capability Discovery → Capability Pilot → Controlled Cutover Program.
- **Best for:** Organizations with executive sponsorship to act on dependency risk.
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (discovery) + 4-8 weeks (pilot) + roadmap-led (cutover program).
- **What you get:** End-to-end governance with evidence gates at every phase transition.
- **How it starts:** [Begin with Capability Discovery](/services).

## Lighter baseline start
- **Structure:** Short execution baseline for one workflow.
- **Best for:** Teams that need internal confidence before proposing a larger engagement.
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks.
- **What you get:** Capability control map and stabilization plan for one workflow.
- **How it starts:** [Start with discovery](/services).

## When to pick each path

| Consideration | Standard program | Lighter baseline |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Executive sponsorship | In place | Not yet secured |
| Budget | Program-level | Project-level |
| Risk tolerance | Ready to pilot | Need proof first |
| Desired outcome | Production cutover | Decision-ready artifact |
| Timeline pressure | Immediate | Exploratory |

Both paths use the same method, governance controls, and evidence standards. The lighter baseline is a subset of Phase 1.
