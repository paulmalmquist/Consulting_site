Every engagement follows a three-phase structure. Each phase has a defined scope, concrete deliverables, and a leadership decision gate. Nothing advances without evidence.

## Phase 1: Dependency Diagnostic

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

**Focus:** Map dependency risk, contract exposure, and continuity baselines for one critical capability.

**Deliverables:**
- Capability control map showing cross-functional owners, supporting systems, and where control leaks
- Dependency risk profile with contract and continuity exposure
- Recommended first capability to pilot

**Decision gate:** Leadership chooses the first capability to pilot — or stops here with a clear map of risk.

## Phase 2: Capability Pilot

**Duration:** 4-8 weeks

**Focus:** Run one ringfenced capability in parallel with existing systems. Reconciliations and rollback criteria are defined before execution begins.

**Deliverables:**
- Parallel-run design with reconciliation routines
- Rollback triggers and escalation paths
- Evidence log showing pilot outcomes against agreed success criteria

**Decision gate:** Leadership approves cutover, extends the pilot, or stops safely — based on evidence, not momentum.

## Phase 3: Controlled Cutover Program

**Duration:** Roadmap-led (quarter by quarter)

**Focus:** Sequence capability cutovers with clear governance gates. Each cutover follows the same evidence-led pattern proven in the pilot.

**Deliverables:**
- Cutover governance pack with decision checkpoints and approval criteria
- Sequenced capability roadmap tied to business risk
- Evidence expectations for executive sign-off at each gate

**Decision gate:** Scale with clarity, not momentum. Each capability cutover is independently approved.

## Risk controls

At every phase, three controls are non-negotiable:

1. **Ownership is named.** Every capability has a single accountable owner with decision authority.
2. **Evidence precedes action.** No cutover happens without reconciliation data and agreed success criteria.
3. **Rollback is always available.** Parallel-run architecture means the old path stays live until the new one is proven.
