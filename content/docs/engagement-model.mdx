Every engagement follows three phases. Each phase has defined scope, concrete deliverables, and a leadership decision gate.

## Phase 1: Capability Discovery
- **Duration:** 2-3 weeks.
- **Focus:** Map dependency risk, contract exposure, and continuity baselines for one critical capability.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Capability control map showing owners, supporting systems, and control leaks.
  - Dependency risk profile with contract and continuity exposure.
  - Recommended first capability to pilot.
- **Decision gate:** Leadership chooses the first capability to pilot or stops with a clear map of risk.

## Phase 2: Capability Pilot
- **Duration:** 4-8 weeks.
- **Focus:** Run one ringfenced capability in parallel with existing systems.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Parallel-run design with reconciliation routines.
  - Rollback triggers and escalation paths.
  - Evidence log showing outcomes against agreed success criteria.
- **Decision gate:** Leadership approves cutover, extends the pilot, or stops safely based on evidence.

## Phase 3: Controlled Cutover Program
- **Duration:** Roadmap-led (quarter by quarter).
- **Focus:** Sequence capability cutovers with clear governance gates.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Cutover governance pack with decision checkpoints and approval criteria.
  - Sequenced capability roadmap tied to business risk.
  - Evidence expectations for executive sign-off at each gate.
- **Decision gate:** Each capability cutover is independently approved.

## Risk controls
1. **Ownership is named.** Every capability has a single accountable owner with decision authority.
2. **Evidence precedes action.** No cutover happens without reconciliation data and agreed success criteria.
3. **Rollback is always available.** Parallel-run architecture keeps the old path live until the new one is proven.
