Enterprise system dependency builds quietly in side tools, inboxes, and hand-built workarounds.

## Where dependency actually hides
- **Spreadsheets become the operating layer.** Execution lives in Excel files, shared drives, and personal trackers.
- **Temporary fixes harden into process.** Workarounds become the default without clear ownership.
- **Approval chains multiply.** New compliance steps blur who approves what.
- **Every improvement becomes a platform debate.** Nothing ships because nothing can be isolated from the monolith.

## Why this matters
- Confidence drops when systems are overbuilt and under-trusted.
- Leaders cannot see the blast radius to approve change.
- Teams cannot execute without control of dependencies.
- Operational drift pushes work outside governed systems.

## What to do about it
Map one critical capability: owner, decision points, and systems involved. That is what [Capability Discovery](/services) delivers in 2-3 weeks.
