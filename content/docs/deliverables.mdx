Every phase produces decision-ready artifacts — not slide decks. Each deliverable is designed so leadership can approve, pause, or redirect with confidence.

## What you leave with

- **A plain-language map** of where dependency creates risk — not a technical architecture diagram, but a cross-functional view that operations, finance, and compliance can all read.
- **Named owners, control points, and decision criteria** for the capability in scope.
- **A sequenced pilot-to-cutover plan** tied to business risk, not vendor timelines.
- **Evidence gates** leaders can use to approve or pause change at every step.

## Concrete deliverables by phase

### Capability control map

Cross-functional view of the capability, supporting systems, and where control leaks. Shows who owns what, where handoffs break, and where work has drifted outside governed systems.

**Produced in:** Capability Discovery (Phase 1)

### Stabilization plan

Targeted interventions that stop spreadsheet sprawl and patch brittle handoffs — without replacing core systems. Focuses on reducing fragility before modernization begins.

**Produced in:** Capability Discovery (Phase 1)

### Pilot design

Parallel-run design, reconciliation routines, and rollback triggers — all defined before execution. Includes success criteria agreed with leadership so the pilot has a clear pass/fail threshold.

**Produced in:** Capability Pilot (Phase 2)

### Cutover governance pack

Decision checkpoints, approval criteria, and evidence expectations for executive control. Designed so leadership can approve each cutover independently based on evidence, not project momentum.

**Produced in:** Controlled Cutover Program (Phase 3)

## How deliverables are used

Each artifact is designed for a specific audience and decision:

| Artifact | Audience | Decision it supports |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Capability control map | Ops + Finance + Compliance | Where to focus first |
| Stabilization plan | Ops leadership | What to fix before modernizing |
| Pilot design | Program sponsors | Whether to approve the pilot |
| Cutover governance pack | Executive sponsors | Whether to approve each cutover |
