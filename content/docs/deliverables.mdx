Every phase produces decision-ready artifacts, not slide decks.

## What you leave with
- A plain-language map of where dependency creates risk.
- Named owners, control points, and decision criteria for the capability in scope.
- A sequenced pilot-to-cutover plan tied to business risk.
- Evidence gates leaders can use to approve, pause, or redirect.

## Concrete deliverables by phase

### Capability control map
- Cross-functional view of the capability, supporting systems, and control leaks.
- Highlights owners, handoffs, and where work drifts outside governed systems.
- **Produced in:** Capability Discovery (Phase 1).

### Stabilization plan
- Targeted interventions that stop spreadsheet sprawl and patch brittle handoffs.
- Reduces fragility before modernization begins.
- **Produced in:** Capability Discovery (Phase 1).

### Pilot design
- Parallel-run design with reconciliation routines and rollback triggers.
- Success criteria agreed with leadership before execution.
- **Produced in:** Capability Pilot (Phase 2).

### Cutover governance pack
- Decision checkpoints, approval criteria, and evidence expectations for executive control.
- Each cutover is independently approved based on evidence.
- **Produced in:** Controlled Cutover Program (Phase 3).
