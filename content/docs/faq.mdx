## Do we have to replace systems of record?

No. Systems of record stay in place while we redesign the execution layer around them. We focus on how work flows between systems — not on replacing the systems themselves. Replacement only happens where evidence supports it, and only after a controlled pilot proves the new path works.

## How do you control risk?

Each phase defines ownership, evidence, and rollback criteria before change happens. Leaders keep control of scope and approvals at every decision gate.

Specifically: every capability pilot runs in parallel with the existing process. Reconciliation routines compare old and new paths continuously. Rollback triggers are defined in advance. Nothing cuts over until evidence meets criteria agreed with leadership.

## What does "capability-first" mean?

We define the business capability first: owner, decisions, and evidence. Tools follow the capability, not the other way around.

Most modernization projects start with technology selection. We start with the question: what does this capability need to do, who owns it, and how do we know it is working? Once that is clear, tool decisions become straightforward — and often simpler than expected.

## How do you prove outcomes before scaling?

We run controlled pilots with parallel reconciliations and agreed criteria. Outcomes are verified before broader cutover.

The pilot phase produces an evidence log that shows exactly how the new capability performed against the old path. Leadership reviews this evidence at the decision gate and approves, extends, or stops — based on data, not project momentum.

## Is this software or consulting?

This is governed execution design and delivery. We bring method, sequencing, and evidence controls; your systems remain yours.

We do not sell software, license platforms, or take referral fees. We design and deliver the execution path — then hand over operational ownership to your team.

## How long does a typical engagement take?

Capability Discovery takes 2-3 weeks. The Capability Pilot runs 4-8 weeks. The Controlled Cutover Program is roadmap-led and scales quarter by quarter. You can stop after any phase with usable deliverables.

## What if we just need a quick assessment?

Start with the [lighter baseline option](/docs/engagement-options). It maps one workflow, clarifies boundaries, and produces a capability control map in 2-3 weeks — without committing to a full program.
