## Do we have to replace systems of record?
No. Systems of record stay in place while we redesign the execution layer around them. Replacement happens only where evidence supports it after a controlled pilot.

## How do you control risk?
- Ownership, evidence, and rollback criteria are defined before change.
- Every pilot runs in parallel with the existing process.
- Reconciliation routines compare old and new paths continuously.
- Nothing cuts over until evidence meets criteria agreed with leadership.

## What does "capability-first" mean?
We define the business capability first: owner, decisions, and evidence. Tools follow the capability, not the other way around.

## How do you prove outcomes before scaling?
Controlled pilots produce an evidence log that shows performance against the old path. Leadership reviews the evidence and approves, extends, or stops based on data.

## Is this software or consulting?
This is governed execution design and delivery. We bring method, sequencing, and evidence controls; your systems remain yours. We do not sell software or take referral fees.

## How long does a typical engagement take?
- Capability Discovery: 2-3 weeks.
- Capability Pilot: 4-8 weeks.
- Controlled Cutover Program: roadmap-led, quarter by quarter.

## What if we just need a quick assessment?
Start with the [lighter baseline option](/docs/engagement-options). It maps one workflow, clarifies boundaries, and produces a capability control map in 2-3 weeks.
