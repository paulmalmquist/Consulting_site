We are not a staffing firm, a software vendor, or a systems integrator. We are a governed execution design practice.

## No vendor bias
- Tool-agnostic and capability-led.
- Design around existing systems when they can support the capability.
- Specify requirements without selling software or taking referral fees.

## No staff-aug theater
- We own sequencing, evidence design, and governance structure.
- Every engagement has a named lead accountable for method and decision gates.
- We do not backfill your team.

## Operator-first execution
- Systems of record stay.
- The execution layer is redesigned with oversight and auditability.
- Operators regain control without losing continuity.

## What we bring vs. what stays yours

| We bring | You keep |
|----------|----------|
| Method and sequencing | Systems of record |
| Evidence design and governance gates | Decision authority |
| Parallel-run architecture | Operational ownership |
| Rollback triggers and escalation paths | Budget and timeline control |

## How this shows up in practice
- Define capability boundaries before touching any system.
- Design rollback paths before running any pilot.
- Present evidence before recommending any cutover.
- Hand over operational ownership before closing any engagement.

The result: your teams own the outcome. We own the method that got them there.
