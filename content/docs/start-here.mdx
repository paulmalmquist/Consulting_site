We help operators reduce enterprise system dependency without risky full replatforms. We start with one high-friction capability, run a controlled pilot, and scale only when evidence is clear. Systems of record stay in place; governance and auditability stay intact.

## Who this is for

Operations leaders, IT executives, and program sponsors who are stuck between two bad options: keep paying for overbuilt platforms that no one trusts, or commit to a full replatform that takes years and carries real downtime risk.

If your teams have built workarounds on top of workarounds — spreadsheets, side tools, manual handoffs — and every improvement proposal turns into a platform debate, this is built for you.

## Who this is not for

Teams looking for staff augmentation, software product selection, or general technology advisory. We focus on governed execution design and evidence-led modernization — not recommendations without accountability.
