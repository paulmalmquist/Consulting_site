## What we do
- Reduce enterprise system dependency without risky full replatforms.
- Start with one high-friction capability and run a controlled pilot.
- Scale only when evidence is clear; systems of record stay in place.

## Who this is for
- Operations leaders, IT executives, and program sponsors.
- Teams stuck between paying for overbuilt platforms or risky full replatforms.
- Organizations carrying workarounds: spreadsheets, side tools, manual handoffs.

## Who this is not for
- Staff augmentation, software product selection, or general technology advisory.
- Recommendations without accountability.
