I build AI readiness programs for operators — leaders who are responsible for outcomes, not hype. My background spans construction delivery, finance operations, and data strategy, which means I see the full stack: field work, decision chains, and governance.

My focus is operational truth: the real workflows, the unspoken workarounds, and the decision ladders that control risk. AI can only compress work if these inputs are explicit.

### Principles
- **Operational clarity first.** Map how work flows before changing it.
- **Human-in-the-loop by design.** Approval and escalation are part of the product.
- **Auditability over vanity.** Every output must be defensible.

### What I’m not
I’m not selling a tool, and I’m not chasing hype. The work is about durable operating models that can absorb AI without breaking trust.

### Now
I’m working with a small number of teams who need to move quickly, prove value, and keep governance intact.
