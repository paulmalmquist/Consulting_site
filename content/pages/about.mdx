## What we do
- Build internal execution capability so teams can run, adapt, and govern critical workflows without platform lock-in.
- Convert fragmented data and manual handoffs into governed operating systems.
- Keep people in control with clear approval paths, auditable logic, and measurable performance.

## Why this team works
- We combine deep data engineering and analytics execution with risk, underwriting, and governance leadership.
- We have operated inside complex environments where speed, compliance, and decision quality all matter at the same time.
- Our approach is practical: map work as it is, reduce hidden tax, and build systems that hold up under real operating pressure.

## Team

### Paul Malmquist
Data engineering and analytics leader with operating depth across private equity real estate, construction delivery, and enterprise reporting.

- Built governed analytics foundations and reusable semantic models across large, multi-stakeholder environments.
- Led delivery teams and offshore execution models that moved reporting from analyst-dependent to system-driven.
- Designed data pipelines and operational BI systems that reduced reconciliation work, improved data quality, and accelerated executive reporting.
- Applied Python, SQL, Databricks, Power BI, and workflow automation to make finance and operations data decision-ready.

### Richard De Oliveira
Risk and credit strategy leader with extensive experience in underwriting, portfolio management, and regulated decision systems.

- Advised enterprise clients on integrating predictive analytics into account lifecycle decisions.
- Led risk management teams responsible for high-volume lending and portfolio performance.
- Improved decision automation, reduced expected loss, and strengthened policy and compliance alignment.
- Built decision frameworks, monitoring, and cross-functional operating rhythms that balance growth with control.

## Representative outcomes
- Faster reporting cycles through centralized data models and standardized definitions.
- Reduced operational drag by replacing manual reconciliation with validated pipelines.
- Improved decision quality through measurable risk controls and monitoring.
- Stronger governance through explicit logic, review paths, and audit-ready records.

## Operating principles
- **Operational truth first.** We map real workflows, not idealized diagrams.
- **Capability ownership.** Critical logic and data stay with your team.
- **Human-in-the-loop by design.** Exceptions, approvals, and escalation are built in.
- **Governed speed.** Move quickly without trading away control.

## Where we focus
- Operational assessment and workflow redesign
- Internal execution engines for recurring work
- AI and automation applied to governed, high-value workflows
- Legacy SaaS migration where ownership, flexibility, and cost control matter
