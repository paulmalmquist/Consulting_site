I help operators reduce system dependency without risky, all-at-once transformations. My background spans construction delivery, finance operations, and data strategy, so I work across field execution, decision chains, and governance.

My focus is operational truth: the real workflow, the hidden workarounds, and the approval ladders that actually control risk. Modernization only works when those inputs are explicit.

### Principles
- **Operational clarity first.** Map how work flows before changing it.
- **Human-in-the-loop by design.** Approval and escalation are part of the product.
- **Auditability over vanity.** Every output must be defensible.

### What I’m not
I’m not selling a tool, and I’m not chasing hype. The work is about durable operating models that can absorb AI without breaking trust.

### Now
I’m working with a small number of teams who need to move quickly, prove value, and keep governance intact.
