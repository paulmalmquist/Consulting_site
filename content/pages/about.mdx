## Focus
- Reduce system dependency without risky, all-at-once transformations.
- Work across construction delivery, finance operations, and data strategy.
- Align field execution, decision chains, and governance.

## Operating stance
- Operational truth first: real workflows, hidden workarounds, approval ladders.
- Modernization works only when those inputs are explicit.

### Principles
- **Operational clarity first.** Map how work flows before changing it.
- **Human-in-the-loop by design.** Approval and escalation are part of the product.
- **Auditability over vanity.** Every output must be defensible.

### What I’m not
- Not selling a tool.
- Not chasing hype.
- Building durable operating models that can absorb AI without breaking trust.

### Now
- Working with a small number of teams who need to move quickly, prove value, and keep governance intact.
