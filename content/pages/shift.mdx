## Operating-regime shift

- Then: specialized SaaS tools split execution across teams.
- Now: one internal execution engine runs workflows over unified data.

## What changes

- Data and process logic are governed in one place.
- AI and automation execute repeatable work consistently.
- Humans approve exceptions with full audit evidence.

## Outcomes

- Lower long-term cost.
- Faster process changes without major migrations.
- Traceable runs, replay capability, and continuity across teams.

## Next step

Run an [operational assessment](/operational-assessment) to inventory current execution and sequence consolidation.
