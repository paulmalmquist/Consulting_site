## Professional Services
- Proposal intake, scope validation, staffing decisions.
- Risk: client commitments made without capacity visibility.

## Construction / PDS
- Change order triage, RFI escalation, vendor compliance.
- Risk: decision latency creates cost overruns.

## Finance Ops
- Approvals, exception handling, reconciliation workflows.
- Risk: manual overrides without audit trails.

## Healthcare Admin
- Prior authorization, patient intake, claims exceptions.
- Risk: compliance gaps and inconsistent escalations.

## Insurance Ops
- Claims routing, fraud detection escalation, vendor approvals.
- Risk: inconsistent human-in-the-loop thresholds.

## What stays consistent
Across industries, the same pattern holds: clarify decision rights, compress handoffs, and enforce governance with evidence.
