## Healthcare (admin ops)
**Example workflows**
- Scheduling and rescheduling rules
- Prior auth and eligibility checks
- Billing exceptions and follow-up

**Common metrics we track (examples)**
- Time from intake to resolved billing exception
- % of claims needing manual rework
- Approval cycle time for prior auth

## Legal ops
**Example workflows**
- Intake and triage for new matters
- Document review routing and exceptions
- Matter status updates and approvals

**Common metrics we track (examples)**
- Time to route a new intake request
- % of matters missing required context
- Escalation rate for exceptions

## Construction / PDS
**Example workflows**
- Change order approvals and thresholds
- Bid review and compliance checks
- RFI routing and escalation

**Common metrics we track (examples)**
- Cycle time for change orders
- % of bids needing rework
- Aging of RFIs by status

## What stays consistent
Across industries, the same pattern holds: clarify decision rights, compress handoffs, and enforce governance with evidence.
