## How it works

### 1) Map real workflows (not titles)
We capture how work actually moves: intake, handoffs, systems of record, and rework loops.

### 2) Capture decisions, rules, and exceptions
We document decision ladders, thresholds, overrides, and the exceptions that slow delivery.

### 3) Build the Operational Decision Twin
We create a virtual ops lab (the Decision Twin) where workflows can be tested without touching production.

### 4) Design HITL + governance
We define human-in-the-loop checkpoints, audit evidence, and ownership so the model is defensible.

### 5) Prove value safely
We run controlled scenarios with observable outcomes before any production change.

## Deliverables
- Decision map (workflow truth)
- Data + context inventory
- Microcosm (synthetic facsimile)
- Simulation scenarios (what-if)
- Governance + HITL guardrails
- Executive walkthrough + roadmap

## Governance stance
Every recommendation is tied to auditability. Systems of record stay; systems of work are redesigned.
