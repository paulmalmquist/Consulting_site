## How it works

### 1) Map real workflows (not titles)
We capture how work actually moves: intake, handoffs, systems of record, and rework loops.

### 2) Capture decisions, rules, and exceptions
We document decision ladders, thresholds, overrides, and the exceptions that slow delivery.

### 3) Identify workflow compression opportunities
We isolate where retrieval, rules, or structured AI can reduce decision latency without increasing risk.

### 4) Design HITL + governance
We define human-in-the-loop checkpoints, audit evidence, and ownership so the model is defensible.

### 5) Pilot safely
We run a controlled pilot with observable outcomes, not hype metrics.

## Deliverables
- Workflow compression map
- Decision ladder with escalation rules
- Governance charter and audit evidence requirements
- Pilot plan with HITL checkpoints

## Governance stance
Every recommendation is tied to auditability. Systems of record stay; systems of work are redesigned.
