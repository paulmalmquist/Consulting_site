## Our stance
Systems of record should remain stable. Capabilities that create drag should not. We separate the two so you can reduce dependency without introducing operational risk.

## The method (high level)

### 1) Clarify the capability
We define the specific capability in business terms: the outcomes it must produce, the decisions it drives, and the tolerance for error, delay, and exception handling.

### 2) Map dependency and control points
We document where the capability depends on enterprise systems, manual workarounds, and cross-team approvals. We also identify the control points that must remain intact for audit, finance, and operations.

### 3) Establish continuity baselines
Before proposing a replacement, we agree on what “safe and equivalent” means. This includes reconciliations, reporting checks, and the operational signals leaders need to trust the change.

### 4) Run in parallel and learn safely
We stand up the replacement capability alongside the current path. Outputs are compared, exceptions are surfaced, and decision rights stay explicit.

### 5) Cut over with optionality intact
Cutover is treated as a governance decision, not a technical milestone. Rollback criteria, owners, and approval gates are defined up front so optionality is preserved.

## Example capability modules
We do not lead with vendors. We lead with capabilities that matter to executives:
- **Accounting and close support:** reconciliations, approvals, and close checklists
- **CRM workflow control:** routing, ownership rules, and pipeline hygiene
- **Project and portfolio management:** intake, prioritization, and status control
- **Legal operations:** intake triage, obligation tracking, and escalation paths
- **Operational analytics:** executive reporting, metric definitions, and reconciliations

## Why this builds trust across the C-suite
- **CFO confidence:** every change is tied to baselines, reconciliations, and financial clarity.
- **CIO confidence:** systems of record are respected while dependency risk is actively reduced.
- **Operations confidence:** capability cutovers are staged, observable, and reversible.

## FAQ: risk, data integrity, and continuity
**How do you protect data integrity?**
We avoid uncontrolled writes, retain clear ownership of systems of record, and validate outputs during parallel runs before any cutover.

**How do you ensure continuity during cutover?**
We define continuity baselines up front, run in parallel, and require named executive approval before traffic shifts.

**What if priorities change midstream?**
Because the work is capability-based, sequencing can change without invalidating the entire program. Optionality is a design requirement, not a slogan.
