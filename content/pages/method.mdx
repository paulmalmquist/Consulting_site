## The phased method

### Phase 1: Work Reality Audit
We document how work actually flows — intake, handoffs, exceptions, and rework loops. This creates the baseline for AI readiness.

### Phase 2: AI Compression Analysis
We isolate the workflows with the highest decision latency and the most expensive escalations. We then identify where retrieval, rules, or HITL can compress time.

### Phase 3: Role/Workflow Consolidation Scenarios
We consolidate decision ownership, align responsibilities, and remove redundant approvals.

### Phase 4: Executive Cover Package
Leaders need a narrative that makes the change defensible. We provide a strategy narrative, governance map, and risk posture summary.

### Phase 5: Pilot (human-in-the-loop)
We implement a controlled pilot with human oversight and audit trails to prove operational value.

## Deliverables
- Workflow compression map
- Decision ladder with escalation rules
- Governance charter
- Pilot scorecard and metrics

## Governance stance
Every recommendation is tied to auditability. Human-in-the-loop checkpoints are explicit, not implied.
