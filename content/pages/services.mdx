## The promise
We help you reduce dependency on oversized enterprise systems while preserving mission-critical capabilities. The work is designed to lower risk at each step, not introduce it.

## What this is
- **Capability-first modernization:** we start with one workflow capability, not a vendor stack.
- **Evidence-led execution:** recommendations must pass continuity and reconciliation gates.
- **Operator-focused delivery:** we stay accountable through pilot and cutover decisions.

## The three phases

### 1) Dependency Diagnostic
**Focus**
Identify where dependency is truly risky versus merely inconvenient.

**What you get**
- Capability dependency map across systems, data, approvals, and workarounds
- Contract and change-cost exposure snapshot
- Continuity baselines with initial reconciliation checks
- Shortlist of capability candidates safe to ringfence

**Decisions enabled**
Where to act first, what to leave alone, and what needs deeper validation.

### 2) Capability Pilot
**Focus**
Run one ringfenced capability in parallel until evidence is clear.

**What you get**
- Capability scope with named owners, upstreams, and downstreams
- Parallel-run design with exception handling and escalation paths
- Reconciliation routines to protect finance, compliance, and operations
- Cutover criteria and rollback triggers defined before execution

**Decisions enabled**
Approve cutover, extend the pilot, or stop safely.

### 3) Controlled Cutover Program
**Focus**
Sequence capability cutovers quarter by quarter without a full rip-and-replace program.

**What you get**
- Capability roadmap tied to financial exposure and operational risk
- Executive control narrative for each cutover decision
- Governance routines that preserve optionality as you modernize
- Program reporting that shows dependency reduction over time

**Decisions enabled**
Scale with clarity, not momentum.

## Best fit
This is a strong fit when:
- You are paying enterprise-system costs but rely on a narrow set of capabilities.
- You need savings and control improvements without destabilizing reporting.
- You operate under audit, compliance, or board-level scrutiny.
- You want optionality and proof, not a multi-year leap of faith.

## Not a fit
This is likely not a fit when:
- You are already committed to a full rip-and-replace transformation.
- You want a vendor selection exercise more than a dependency reduction program.
- You need staff augmentation rather than accountable, senior execution.

## Executive FAQ
**How do you make sure finance is protected?**
We define continuity baselines early, design reconciliations into pilots, and require evidence before any cutover recommendation is made.

**How do you avoid creating another layer of complexity?**
We ringfence capabilities specifically to remove complexity. If a proposed change cannot reduce dependency or improve control, it does not ship.

**Do you work with our existing vendors and systems integrators?**
Yes. We focus on capability clarity and risk reduction, and we coordinate with the vendors you rely on today.
