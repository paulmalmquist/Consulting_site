## The promise
- Reduce dependency on oversized enterprise systems.
- Preserve mission-critical capabilities.
- Lower risk at each step, not introduce it.

## What this is
- **Capability-first modernization:** we start with one workflow capability, not a vendor stack.
- **Evidence-led execution:** recommendations must pass continuity and reconciliation gates.
- **Operator-focused delivery:** we stay accountable through pilot and cutover decisions.

## The three phases

### 1) Capability Discovery
**Focus:** Identify where dependency is truly risky versus merely inconvenient.

**What you get**
- Capability dependency map across systems, data, approvals, and workarounds.
- Contract and change-cost exposure snapshot.
- Continuity baselines with initial reconciliation checks.
- Shortlist of capability candidates safe to ringfence.

**Decisions enabled:** Where to act first, what to leave alone, and what needs deeper validation.

### 2) Capability Pilot
**Focus:** Run one ringfenced capability in parallel until evidence is clear.

**What you get**
- Capability scope with named owners, upstreams, and downstreams.
- Parallel-run design with exception handling and escalation paths.
- Reconciliation routines to protect finance, compliance, and operations.
- Cutover criteria and rollback triggers defined before execution.

**Decisions enabled:** Approve cutover, extend the pilot, or stop safely.

### 3) Controlled Cutover Program
**Focus:** Sequence capability cutovers quarter by quarter without a full rip-and-replace program.

**What you get**
- Capability roadmap tied to financial exposure and operational risk.
- Executive control narrative for each cutover decision.
- Governance routines that preserve optionality as you modernize.
- Program reporting that shows dependency reduction over time.

**Decisions enabled:** Scale with clarity, not momentum.

## Fit check

| Strong fit | Not a fit |
| --- | --- |
| Paying enterprise-system costs but relying on a narrow set of capabilities. | Already committed to a full rip-and-replace transformation. |
| Need savings and control improvements without destabilizing reporting. | Want a vendor selection exercise more than dependency reduction. |
| Operate under audit, compliance, or board-level scrutiny. | Need staff augmentation rather than accountable, senior execution. |
| Want optionality and proof, not a multi-year leap of faith. |  |

## Executive FAQ
**How do you make sure finance is protected?**
Continuity baselines are defined early, reconciliations are built into pilots, and evidence is required before any cutover recommendation.

**How do you avoid creating another layer of complexity?**
Capabilities are ringfenced specifically to remove complexity. If a change does not reduce dependency or improve control, it does not ship.

**Do you work with our existing vendors and systems integrators?**
Yes. We focus on capability clarity and risk reduction, and coordinate with the vendors you rely on today.
