## What I do
I help operations leaders compress workflows, reduce decision latency, and build governance that survives real audit conditions. The focus is on systems of work (how people actually execute) and systems of record (how outcomes are logged and defended).

## Who it’s for
- CTOs and COOs facing AI pressure but needing operational clarity.
- Operations teams burdened by SaaS sprawl and manual escalations.
- Leaders who need a human-in-the-loop model with auditability built in.

## Core offers

### 1) AI Readiness Diagnostic (2 weeks)
**Outcomes**
- Clear baseline of workflow health, risk posture, and decision latency.
- Shortlist of workflows ready for compression or AI augmentation.

**Inputs needed**
- Stakeholder interviews, workflow docs, and access to systems of record.

**Deliverables**
- Readiness scorecard, workflow heat map, and governance gap analysis.

**Timeline**
- 10 business days, fast-turn research + synthesis.

**Typical stakeholders**
- CTO/COO, operations lead, compliance, data owners.

**Pricing approach**
- Scoped engagement based on team size and workflow complexity.

### 2) Workflow & Decision Inventory (2–4 weeks)
**Outcomes**
- Comprehensive inventory of decision points, owners, and thresholds.

**Inputs needed**
- Intake logs, QA data, and escalation paths.

**Deliverables**
- Decision ladder, handoff map, and automation readiness scoring.

**Timeline**
- 2–4 weeks depending on workflow count.

**Typical stakeholders**
- Operations, finance, IT, and line-of-business leaders.

**Pricing approach**
- Scoped engagement aligned to number of workflows and locations.

### 3) AI Governance & Operating Model (2–6 weeks)
**Outcomes**
- Governance framework designed for auditability and human oversight.

**Inputs needed**
- Risk policies, compliance standards, vendor contracts.

**Deliverables**
- Governance charter, RACI matrix, escalation policies, and training plan.

**Timeline**
- 2–6 weeks based on regulatory complexity.

**Typical stakeholders**
- Legal, risk, compliance, and executive sponsors.

**Pricing approach**
- Scoped engagement based on governance scope and regions.

### 4) SaaS Dependency & Internalization Strategy (optional)
**Outcomes**
- Clarity on vendor risk, lock-in exposure, and internal capability gaps.

**Inputs needed**
- Vendor contracts, architecture diagrams, cost models.

**Deliverables**
- Dependency map, internalization options, and phased exit plan.

**Timeline**
- 2–4 weeks.

**Typical stakeholders**
- CTO, procurement, finance.

**Pricing approach**
- Scoped engagement tied to vendor count.

### 5) Implementation Pilot (optional)
**Outcomes**
- Controlled pilot that proves workflow compression with governance intact.

**Inputs needed**
- Selected workflow, data sources, and executive sponsor.

**Deliverables**
- Pilot roadmap, success metrics, and risk controls.

**Timeline**
- 4–8 weeks depending on scope.

**Typical stakeholders**
- Operations leaders, IT, change management.

**Pricing approach**
- Scoped engagement based on pilot scope.

## Governance stance
I prioritize auditability, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, and decision rights. Automation is earned, not assumed.

## FAQ
**Do you sell software?**
No. I stay tool-agnostic and help you decide what should be internal vs vendor-owned.

**Can this work without a dedicated data team?**
Yes. We start with operational truth and identify the minimal data assets needed.

**How do you avoid AI hype?**
We use measurable workflow compression and decision latency as the baseline for every recommendation.
