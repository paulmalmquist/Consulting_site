## How I Help
I focus on workflow truth, decision latency, and governance-safe execution. Most teams start with a short, fixed-scope pilot to validate outcomes without a long-term commitment.

### 1) Discovery & Foundation
**What you get**
Assessment, stakeholder interviews, workflow mapping, and a prioritized roadmap.

**Typical timeline**
1–2 weeks.

**Decision it enables**
Confirm which workflows to pilot and whether a Proof-of-Concept is the right next step.

### 2) Proof-of-Concept / Pilot
**What you get**
One or two real workflows modeled in a safe, non-production environment with clear success criteria.

**Typical timeline**
2–4 weeks.

**Decision it enables**
Decide whether to scale and which workflows to expand.

### 3) Scale & Ongoing
**What you get**
Expansion to additional workflows, governance and HITL tuning, and operating model support.

**Typical timeline**
Monthly cycles.

**Decision it enables**
Decide when to standardize and operationalize across teams.

## Engagement safeguards
- Fixed scope for each phase so outcomes stay clear.
- Defined exit points after Discovery and after the Pilot.
- Success criteria agreed before work begins.
- Option to stop after the Pilot if it does not meet the criteria.

## Governance stance
AI is only durable when decision rights and auditability are explicit. Systems of record stay in place; systems of work are redesigned.

## FAQ
**Do you sell software?**
No. I stay tool-agnostic and focus on operational clarity.

**What makes this different from analytics or BI consulting?**
The work centers on workflows, decision rights, and governance — not dashboards.

**How do you avoid AI hype?**
Every recommendation is tied to workflow compression, decision latency, and auditability.
