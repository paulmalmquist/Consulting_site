## The promise
We help you reduce dependency on oversized enterprise systems while preserving mission-critical capabilities. The work is structured to lower risk with each step, not introduce it.

## What makes this different
- **Not a SaaS replacement pitch:** we do not sell a platform or push a license decision.
- **Not traditional consulting theater:** we do not stop at a recommendation deck.
- **Not a replatform program in disguise:** we replace capabilities selectively and prove continuity before cutover.

## The three engagement phases

### 1) Dependency Diagnostic
**Focus**
Establish where dependency is genuinely risky vs. simply inconvenient.

**What you get**
- Capability dependency map (systems, data, approvals, workarounds)
- Contract and change-cost exposure snapshot
- Continuity baselines and reconciliations for critical outcomes
- A short list of capability candidates that are safe to ringfence

**Decisions enabled**
Where to act first, what to leave alone, and what requires deeper validation.

### 2) Capability Pilot
**Focus**
Replace one ringfenced capability and run it in parallel until the evidence is clear.

**What you get**
- Capability scope with named owners, upstreams, and downstreams
- Parallel-run design with exception handling and escalation paths
- Reconciliation routines that protect finance, compliance, and operations
- Cutover criteria and rollback triggers defined before execution begins

**Decisions enabled**
Approve cutover, extend the pilot, or stop safely with a clearer map.

### 3) Controlled Cutover Program
**Focus**
Sequence capability replacements quarter by quarter without committing to a full replatform.

**What you get**
- A capability roadmap tied to financial exposure and operational risk
- Control narratives executives can use to approve each cutover
- Governance routines that keep optionality intact as you modernize
- Program-level reporting that shows dependency reduction over time

**Decisions enabled**
Scale with clarity, not momentum.

## Who this is for
This is a strong fit when:
- You are paying enterprise-system costs but rely on a narrow set of capabilities.
- You need savings and control improvements without destabilizing reporting.
- You operate under audit, compliance, or board-level scrutiny.
- You want optionality and proof, not a multi-year leap of faith.

## Who this is not for
This is not the right fit when:
- You are already committed to a full rip-and-replace replatform.
- You want a vendor selection exercise more than a dependency reduction program.
- You need staff augmentation rather than accountable, senior execution.

## Executive FAQ
**How do you make sure finance is protected?**
We define continuity baselines early, design reconciliations into pilots, and require evidence before any cutover recommendation is made.

**How do you avoid creating another layer of complexity?**
We ringfence capabilities specifically to remove complexity. If a proposed change cannot reduce dependency or improve control, it does not ship.

**Do you work with our existing vendors and systems integrators?**
Yes. We focus on capability clarity and risk reduction, and we coordinate with the vendors you rely on today.
