## How I Help
I focus on workflow truth, decision latency, and governance-safe execution. Every engagement starts with operational reality and ends with measurable proof-of-value.

### 1) QuickStart Proof-of-Value (2–4 weeks)
**Who it’s for**
SMB owners and operators who need fast clarity on what’s safe to change.

**Problem it removes**
Guesswork about what to automate and where risk hides.

**What you get**
Decision map, data/context inventory, and a scoped simulation plan.

**Timebox**
2–4 weeks.

### 2) Operational Decision Twin (4–6 weeks)
**Who it’s for**
Regulated teams that want a virtual ops lab before changing production.

**Problem it removes**
Risky guesswork and slow, manual experimentation.

**What you get**
Decision twin microcosm, simulation scenarios, governance + HITL guardrails, and an executive walkthrough.

**Timebox**
4–6 weeks.

### 3) Intent-Based Internal Support (Module)
**Who it’s for**
HR/IT/helpdesk leaders who need faster routing without losing auditability.

**Problem it removes**
Misrouted tickets, repeat questions, and inconsistent escalation.

**What you get**
Intent capture, context assembly, routing logic, and escalation guardrails.

**Timebox**
2–4 weeks (standalone or as a module).

### 4) CRM + Ticketing Decision Layer (Module)
**Who it’s for**
Sales ops, client services, and back-office leaders who need consistent approvals and status visibility.

**Problem it removes**
Opaque handoffs, stalled approvals, and missing context.

**What you get**
Decision rules, audit trails, and workflow-specific action routing.

**Timebox**
2–4 weeks (standalone or as a module).

## Pricing signals (SMB-friendly)
**QuickStart Proof-of-Value (2–4 weeks)**  
For teams who need fast clarity. Includes decision map, data/context inventory, and a scoped simulation plan.

**Operational Decision Twin (4–6 weeks)**  
For teams ready to test change safely. Includes microcosm, scenarios, governance + HITL guardrails, and executive walkthrough.

**Ongoing Support (monthly)**  
For teams operationalizing the twin. Includes scenario updates, governance tuning, and on-call decision support.

## Governance stance
AI is only durable when decision rights and auditability are explicit. Systems of record stay in place; systems of work are redesigned.

## FAQ
**Do you sell software?**
No. I stay tool-agnostic and focus on operational clarity.

**What makes this different from analytics or BI consulting?**
The work centers on workflows, decision rights, and governance — not dashboards.

**How do you avoid AI hype?**
Every recommendation is tied to workflow compression, decision latency, and auditability.
