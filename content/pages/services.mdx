## How I Help
I focus on workflow compression, decision latency, and governance-safe execution. Every engagement starts with operational truth and ends with a measurable pilot plan.

### 1) AI Readiness Diagnostic (2 weeks)
**Who it’s for**
CTO/COO teams who need clarity on where AI is safe and where governance is thin.

**Problem it removes**
Hidden decision latency, unclear ownership, and risk blind spots.

**What you get**
Readiness scorecard, workflow heat map, risk register, and a 90‑day action brief.

**Timebox**
2 weeks.

### 2) Workflow & Decision Inventory (2–4 weeks)
**Who it’s for**
Operations leaders managing complex handoffs across legal, healthcare, finance, or PDS.

**Problem it removes**
Exception sprawl and approval confusion that slow delivery.

**What you get**
Workflow inventory, decision ladder, exception rules, and escalation paths.

**Timebox**
2–4 weeks.

### 3) Governance-Safe AI Operating Model (2–6 weeks)
**Who it’s for**
Regulated teams that need human-in-the-loop controls and auditability.

**Problem it removes**
Shadow automation and ungoverned AI adoption.

**What you get**
Governance charter, RACI, approval checkpoints, audit trail requirements, and oversight cadence.

**Timebox**
2–6 weeks.

### 4) Back-Office Automation (Legal, Healthcare, Ops) (3–6 weeks)
**Who it’s for**
Back-office leaders overwhelmed by intake, triage, and recurring exceptions.

**Problem it removes**
Manual routing and decision latency that blocks throughput.

**What you get**
Automation blueprint, knowledge base object map, pilot backlog, and HITL checkpoints.

**Timebox**
3–6 weeks.

## Governance stance
AI is only durable when decision rights and auditability are explicit. Systems of record stay in place; systems of work are redesigned.

## FAQ
**Do you sell software?**
No. I stay tool-agnostic and focus on operational clarity.

**What makes this different from analytics or BI consulting?**
The work centers on workflows, decision rights, and governance — not dashboards.

**How do you avoid AI hype?**
Every recommendation is tied to workflow compression, decision latency, and auditability.
