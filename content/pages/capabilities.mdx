## The capability-first approach

**Why it works**
- Oversized enterprise suites treat the system as the capability.
- We decompose suites into individual capabilities.
- We replace only what you need with governed, finance-safe execution.

**Capability-first means:**
- We start with a specific workflow capability, not a vendor platform.
- We run pilots in parallel with reconciliation gates.
- We cut over only when evidence is clear.
- We preserve continuity at every step.

## Core capabilities we deliver

### Capability decomposition
- Identify which suite capabilities you truly depend on.
- Identify which capabilities exist only because the suite exists.
- Map dependencies across systems, workflows, and approvals.
- See exactly what is at risk before you act.

### Replacement execution
- Design and run controlled pilots in parallel with existing systems.
- Build reconciliation routines and define cutover criteria.
- Create rollback triggers before any production change.

### Governance design
- Create executive control structures that preserve optionality.
- Establish evidence requirements and risk gates.
- Define decision frameworks so leadership stays in control.

### Financial protection
- Protect finance, compliance, and audit requirements.
- Define continuity baselines and reconciliation checks.
- Require proof before any recommendation goes forward.

## Why this matters now

**The Salesforce problem:**
- Enterprise costs for CRM suites with narrow capabilities used.
- Custom objects turn into workarounds.
- Licensing costs scale faster than value.
- The suite becomes the capability map, not the business.

**The MRI problem:**
- Leasing-to-accounting bundles lock in mission-critical workflows.
- Upgrades break customizations.
- The exit cost feels higher than the pain of staying.

**The capability-first alternative:**
- Decompose the suite into ringfenced capabilities.
- Replace one workflow at a time with controlled pilots.
- Reduce dependency quarter by quarter without a multi-year transformation program.

## What you get

### For executives
- **Control:** Approve each cutover decision based on evidence, not momentum.
- **Optionality:** Preserve the ability to stop, extend, or redirect at any phase.
- **Clarity:** Understand exactly what is at risk and what savings are real.

### For operators
- **Continuity:** Finance, compliance, and reporting stay protected through every change.
- **Accountability:** Named owners for each capability with clear escalation paths.
- **Proof:** Reconciliation routines that show the pilot works before cutover.

### For finance leaders
- **Risk reduction:** Controlled exposure with rollback triggers at every step.
- **Cost transparency:** See dependency costs broken out by capability, not bundled by vendor.
- **Evidence requirements:** No cutover recommendations without reconciliation proof.

## Fit check

| Strong fit | Not a fit |
| --- | --- |
| Paying enterprise suite costs but relying on a narrow set of capabilities. | Already committed to a full rip-and-replace transformation. |
| Need savings and control improvements without destabilizing reporting. | Want a vendor selection exercise more than a dependency reduction program. |
| Operate under audit, compliance, or board-level scrutiny. | Need staff augmentation rather than accountable, senior execution. |
| Want optionality and proof, not a multi-year leap of faith. |  |
