## Privacy
I collect only the information you provide through direct contact or a scheduling link. I do not sell personal data. Any shared operational data stays confidential and is used solely for the engagement.

## Terms
Engagements are scoped and documented before work begins. All deliverables are provided under a mutually agreed statement of work. Intellectual property remains with the client unless otherwise noted.

## Disclaimers
This site provides general information about operations redesign and dependency reduction. It is not legal or financial advice.
